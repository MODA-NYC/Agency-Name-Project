Notes,Notes about this organization.,object,"While Education Law section 2590-a defines “chancellor” as the “chancellor of the city district,” this phrase would be used primarily outside the sections of the Administrative Code or Charter that are dedicated to education. Therefore, adding in the word “school” will ensure better understanding.

Education Law section 2590-b refers to the “city board of education,” but in its bylaws the board refers to itself as the “Panel for Educational Policy.” The board’s bylaws further indicate that the Panel for Educational Policy, the Chancellor and various other officers and school employees together constitute the Department of Education. See Nacipucha v. City of New York, 18 Misc. 3d 846, 849-54 (Sup. Ct. Bronx Cnty. 2008) (describing structure of Department of Education).

The Department of Education (DOE) in New York City has undergone several name changes throughout its history. Originally established as the Board of Education in the 19th century, the entity was responsible for overseeing public education in the city. In 2002, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration, significant reforms were implemented, leading to the dissolution of the Board of Education. The department was rebranded as the Department of Education (DOE) to reflect its modernized structure and the shift towards greater mayoral control over the city's public schools. This evolution marks the ongoing efforts to improve educational governance and accountability in New York City.; The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) in New York City is commonly referred to by several names, including the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, NYC Health, and the NYC Health Department. These various names are used interchangeably in official documents, public communications, and branding to refer to the same entity responsible for public health, mental health services, and environmental health in New York City. Despite the different names, all references point to the single department tasked with promoting and protecting the health of all New Yorkers.; The Department of Homeless Services (DHS) was merged into the Department of Social Services (DSS) to streamline and enhance the delivery of social services in New York City. This merger combined the resources, staff, and operations of DHS and the Human Resources Administration (HRA) under DSS."
