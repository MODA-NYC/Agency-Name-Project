# Agency Name Project

This project aims to create a standardized list of Agency Names* and publish this as a dataset on the NYC Open Data portal. The primary goal is to enhance data legibility and interoperability by providing official, consistently formatted agency names. This will provide a clear canonical source for how to format Agency Names, improving data quality and saving time when joining datasets on the Agency Name field.

This project is being developed by the Data Governance team in the Office of Data and Analytics.

*The word “Agency” is colloquially used to mean a government organization that includes a New York City Agency, a Mayoral Office, or a Commission.
