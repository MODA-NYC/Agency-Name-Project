On March 16, 2007, Mayor Bloomberg signed Executive Order No. 100, authorizing the Office of Citywide Event Coordination and Management (CECM) with oversight of all event permitting activity in New York City. CECM advises and assists the Mayor in the coordination of policies, plans, procedures, and operations common to the permitting, review, and coordination of street events and other permitted activities. As part of its mission, CECM gathers and disseminates information about upcoming and ongoing public events, including gatherings in City parks, processions, parades, street fairs, block parties, commercial and promotional events, street events, and displays and filming of motion pictures and television. Our goal is to ensure informed decision-making by the various permitting agencies, as well as compliance by permit applicants. CECM also acts as an internal and external resource to the event community on overall event coordination, permitting, and management.
CECM works to enhance communication among various agencies involved in the issuance of permits. This ensures that affected agencies are provided with timely information for proper advance planning to avoid vehicular and pedestrian traffic disruptions, as well as excessive noise in surrounding neighborhoods.
In addition, the Mayor's Street Activity Permit Office (SAPO) was merged into CECM by Executive Order No. 105 of 2007. As a result, the agency exercises all functions, powers, and duties pertaining to street activity permits.
 
Street Activity Permit Office (SAPO):
The Mayor's Office of Citywide Event Coordination and Management (CECM) established within CECM a Street Activity Permit Office and the position of Director of the Street Activity Permit Office. The function of SAPO is to administer the procedures set forth in the SAPO rules. The Director of SAPO shall be consistent with these rules, have the authority to approve or deny any application for a street activity permit, to temporarily suspend or to revoke any street activity permit, or to impose upon the issuance of any street activity permit any conditions necessary to protect the interests of the City, the community and the general public."

",,,,,"'- The NYC Public Engagement Unit (PEU) was created in 2015 to re-envision how the City provides services to its most vulnerable communities and pioneer a new model of government. Rather than expecting constituents to navigate a complex City bureaucracy to get the help they need, PEU’s team of passionate community organizers and case managers adopts grassroots tactics to meet residents where they are — at their doors and on their phones, in their social media feeds and in their communities. PEU staff speak more than 20 languages and often have their own personal stories of benefiting from the City’s public services. By combining proactive outreach and personalized case management, PEU offers vulnerable New Yorkers a comfortable access point to the City, and in doing so, combats disillusionment and builds long-term relationships between New Yorkers and their government.
- Over the past 6 years, PEU has grown from a ten-person pilot team to a 200+ person organization that supports New Yorkers who are often struggling with a myriad of hardships — from landlord abuse, homelessness and eviction to lack of health insurance and food insecurity. As an independent Mayoral Office that works across multiple agencies, PEU is uniquely positioned to break through the bureaucracy and serve New Yorkers holistically, connecting them to services across multiple agencies’ portfolios. PEU’s vantage point also enables critical insights into service delivery for the administration, enabling valuable feedback to City Hall on areas to improve and ways to navigate operational roadblocks.
- PEU is divided into four units focused on health, housing, and civic engagement:
    - The Home Support Unit (HSU) conducts outreach to landlords and brokers (LLBs) in order to identify vacant homes for voucher holders living in shelters. HSU supports LLBs through the entire process of working with the City to ensure that they have a positive experience and choose to continue to provide units to voucher recipients in the future."

However, LGBTQ New Yorkers continue to confront violence, harassment, and discrimination due to their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. LGBTQ youth – especially youth of color – face a confluence of factors such as disproportionate involvement in the justice and foster care systems, housing instability, family rejection, higher rates of violence victimization, and employer discrimination that contribute to greater likelihood of living in poverty than their peers.
- Launched in September 2017 by First Lady Chirlane McCray, Unity Project’s mission is to ensure LGBTQ youth in NYC are safe, supported, and healthy. The Project serves as the citywide interagency coordinating body for LGBTQ policies, programs, communication, and strategy within the Mayor’s Office at City Hall. The Project has invested over $10M in key programs that address LGBTQ youth homelessness, housing instability, family rejection, health inequity and the needs of LGBTQ young people in the foster care system. Key priorities include the following:
    - Tackling LGBTQ Bias, Stigma, and Discrimination
    - Addressing Family Rejection and Building Family Acceptance
    - Supporting LGBTQ Homeless Youth by Investing in Housing and Homelessness Services"

The Fund builds combined-occupancy structures on City-owned land conveyed to the Fund by the City of New York. The school facility portion of the mixed-use project is financed via the issue of tax exempt bonds with a term of up to forty years. ECF uses ground rents, lease payments and/or tax equivalency payments from the non-school portion of projects to finance construction of its school facilities.
