Therefore, adding in the word “school” will ensure better understanding.

Education Law section 2590-b refers to the “city board of education,” but in its bylaws the board refers to itself as the “Panel for Educational Policy.” The board’s bylaws further indicate that the Panel for Educational Policy, the Chancellor and various other officers and school employees together constitute the Department of Education. See Nacipucha v. City of New York, 18 Misc. 3d 846, 849-54 (Sup. Ct. Bronx Cnty. 2008) (describing structure of Department of Education).

The Department of Education (DOE) in New York City has undergone several name changes throughout its history. Originally established as the Board of Education in the 19th century, the entity was responsible for overseeing public education in the city. In 2002, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration, significant reforms were implemented, leading to the dissolution of the Board of Education. The department was rebranded as the Department of Education (DOE) to reflect its modernized structure and the shift towards greater mayoral control over the city's public schools.
