# Technical Implementation Summary

## Script Execution Analysis

### Processing Statistics
- Total matches processed: 1,079
- Successfully processed matches: 355
- Self-referential matches skipped: 203
- Records not found: 521
- Improperly processed matches: 0

### Output Files Generated
1. Final deduplicated dataset: `data/processed/final_deduplicated_dataset.csv`
2. Audit summary: `data/analysis/verified_matches_summary.json`

## Data Processing Details

### Matching Process
The script processed agency name matches with the following approach:
- Applied normalization rules to agency names
- Identified and skipped self-referential matches
- Processed valid matches and updated records
- Maintained audit trail of all processing decisions

### Data Structure
The final deduplicated dataset maintains:
- Original agency names and variations
- Operational status and organization type
- Reporting lines and hierarchical relationships
- Merge history and provenance information
- Normalized name fields for future matching

### Quality Control
- Successfully maintained data integrity during matching
- Preserved key fields and relationships
- Tracked merge history in dedicated columns
- Generated comprehensive audit logs

### Source-Specific Name Preservation
The implementation now properly maintains source-specific agency names:
- Created dedicated `Name - Ops` and `Name - HOO` columns
- Successfully populated 413 `Name - Ops` records from OPS source
- Successfully populated 177 `Name - HOO` records from HOO source
- Implemented intelligent data source tracking:
  - Records marked as 'ops' when `Name - Ops` is present
  - Records marked as 'hoo' when `Name - HOO` is present
  - Records marked as 'nyc_agencies_export' for primary dataset
- Removed invalid/empty records while preserving all valid source names
- Maintained proper data provenance through merge process

## Results Analysis

### Successful Matches
- Handled various agency name formats consistently
- Preserved important metadata during merging
- Maintained clear audit trail of matches

### Areas Needing Attention
1. High number of unmatched records (521)
   - Indicates potential gaps in matching logic
   - Suggests need for more flexible matching rules

2. Data Coverage
   - Some agency variations not found in records
   - Opportunity to expand reference data

### Data Quality
- Consistent formatting of agency names
- Standardized handling of acronyms
- Clear tracking of merge decisions
- Maintained data provenance

## Next Steps
Refer to IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md for specific enhancement proposals to:
- Address missing records
- Enhance normalization rules
- Improve matching accuracy
